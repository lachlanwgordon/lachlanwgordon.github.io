# MAUI UI July
It's Maui UI July which means there are a bunch of great blog posts about creating user interfaces in MAUI coming out all month. You can check out the rest of the posts over at [Matt Goldman's blog](https://goforgoldman.com/2022/05/19/maui-ui-july.html). Thanks to Matt for organising.

For my post, I've teamed up with my buddy Kym Phillpotts. We're both taking on the same UI Challenge, but Kym has created the UI using Maui XAML, and I've built it using Maui Blazor. If you havn't already seen it, check out Kym's blog post from yesterday [MAUI UI Challenge](kymphillpotts.com/maui)

The design we're implementing is a music teacher's app that we found on dribbble, created by Sumit Choudhary. You can check it out at [https://dribbble.com/shots/17453615-Classfly-Music-app-concept]
